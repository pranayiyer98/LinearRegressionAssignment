# Bike Sharing Assignment
> The project involves building a multiple linear regression model to predict the demand for shared bikes based on various factors like weather, season, time, and more. The target variable is the total number of bike rentals. Data preprocessing includes converting categorical variables and evaluating the importance of features such as year. The model's performance will be assessed using the R-squared score to determine how well it predicts bike demand. The goal is to help BoomBikes optimize their services and strategies based on predicted demand patterns.
